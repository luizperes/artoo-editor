# Artoo Editor
Artoo Editor is a text editor for terminals bases on the ncurses library.

### How to use it
Well, imagine that day when you are tired of __vi/vim__, you don't want emacs, plus, you want to change and/or create new themes for your terminal very easily (like using a xml or a json). That is when you gonna choose __artoo__.

- Artoo is gonna be your best friend when you are fighting against the Empire. 
- Artoo is meant for you to show off your new super cool "droid".

### Reason for a new text editor for terminals
The reason why I want to do that is:

__[][][]__ Because I think text editors for terminals are cool.
__[][][][][][][][]__ Because I did not allow myself to use "colored" text editors for C unless I built my own.
__[][][][][][][][][][][][][][]__ Because of the challenge.
__[]__ Because I want to split the __terminal window__ with the __text editor window__. In this case, I can even send my files to my Git repositories without doing __:wq__ first.
__[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]__ Because just because.
__[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]__ And last, but not least, because I can. :)
