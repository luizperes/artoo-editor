# Artoo Editor
Artoo Editor is a text editor for terminals bases on the ncurses library.

### How to use it
Well, imagine that day when you are tired of __vi/vim__, you don't want emacs, plus, you want to change and/or create new themes for your terminal very easily (like using a xml or a json). That is when you gonna choose __artoo__.

- Artoo is gonna be your best friend when you are fighting against the Empire. 
- Artoo is meant for you to show off your new super cool "droid".
- Do you like text editors? __Ar__ __too__ :v

### Reason for a new text editor for terminals
The reason why I want to do that is:

* _Because_ I think text editors for terminals are __cool__.
* _Because_ I did not allow myself to use `"colored"` text editors for C unless I built my own.
* _Because_ of the __challenge__.
* _Because_ I want to split the terminal window with the text editor window. In this case, I can even send my files to my Git repositories without exiting.
* _Because_ just __`cause__.
* And last, but not least, _because_ __I can__. :)
