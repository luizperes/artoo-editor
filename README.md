# Artoo Editor
Artoo Editor is a text editor for terminals bases on the ncurses library.

### How to use it
Well, imagine that day when you are tired of __vi/vim__, you don't want emacs, plus, you want to change and/or create new themes for your terminal very easily (like using a xml or a json). That is when you gonna choose __artoo__.

- Artoo is gonna be your best friend when you are fighting against the Empire. 
- Artoo is meant for you to show off your new super cool "droid".
- Do you like text editors? __Ar__ __too__ :v

### Reason for a new text editor for terminals
The reason why I want to do that is:

* `Because I think text editors for terminals are cool.`
* `Because I did not allow myself to use "colored" text editors for C unless I built my own.`
* `Because of the challenge.`
* `Because I want to split the __terminal window__ with the __text editor window__. In this case, I can even send my files to my Git repositories without doing __:wq__ first.`
* `Because just because.`
* `And last, but not least, because I can. :)`
